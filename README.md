### Welcome

This repository holds my course materials for the *pythonengine* project.

The idead behind this project is to create a tool for automation.
The main parts are a Postgres database, an engine and a webapp for easier management.

The idea is to make this tool pluggable so that you can develop your own extensions while retaining simplicity.

This is a birds eye view of the project.
